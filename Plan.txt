       
	   Plan:
----------------------

For all templates:
  [ ] Load layers

For all palettes:
  Load palette
  For all templates:
    For all layers:
      [ ] Read layer meta data (= the name?) which tells the tool wether to colorize the layer or not
      [ ] If the layer should get colorized: Convert pixel HSV value (= brightness) to color in continuous palette (by finding the two colors on the palette where the pixel's brightness lies between, and
	      use the relative distance to them to calculate the color which should get used in the colorized version)
    [ ] Add all layers together to a single sprite
	[ ] Save new sprite in palette-specific folder
